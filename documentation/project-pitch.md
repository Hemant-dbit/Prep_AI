# Project Pitch: Prep-AI - Revolutionizing Interview Preparation

## Opening Hook (30 seconds)

"Imagine walking into a job interview with the confidence of having practiced with an AI interviewer that not only asks you relevant questions but also analyzes your facial expressions, tone, and responses in real-time. That's exactly what we've built with Prep-AI, a next-generation interview preparation platform that combines artificial intelligence, computer vision, and natural language processing to create the most comprehensive interview practice experience available today."

## Problem Statement (45 seconds)

"Traditional interview preparation methods have three major limitations:

1. Limited feedback on non-verbal communication
2. Generic questions that don't adapt to your experience level
3. No real-time analysis of response quality and delivery

Job seekers spend countless hours practicing in front of mirrors or with friends, but they never get professional-grade feedback on their performance. This leads to increased anxiety and potentially missed opportunities."
